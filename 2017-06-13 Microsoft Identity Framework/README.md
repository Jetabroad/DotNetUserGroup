ASP.NET Identity Framework

In this meetup, Taipan Prasithpongchai talked about Microsoft Identity Framework and its architecture. It's a simple yet powerful framework for authorization and authentication.

He dove into a few implementations and discussed how to provide better security for our users, as well as how claim-based authentication impacts our system.
